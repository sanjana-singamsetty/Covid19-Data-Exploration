## COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The project provides valuable insights into the pandemic's impact and creates informative visualizations to better understand the spread of the virus.

## Features:

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared, handling missing values, converting data types, and removing non-numeric characters.

- Data Scaling: Continuous numeric features are appropriately scaled using standardization or normalization for fair comparisons.

- Data Filtering: The dataset can be filtered based on specific criteria, such as selecting data for a particular country (e.g., USA or Vatican City).

- Data Grouping: The 'groupby' function is used to group data based on columns like countries and perform aggregate calculations (sum, mean, median).

- Data Visualization: Various visualizations are used, including bar charts, histograms, box plots, and pie charts, to present insights from the data.

- Violin Plot: A violin plot is employed to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases for the USA, showing spread and density of data points.

- Descriptive Statistics: Key statistics like quartiles, median, minimum, and maximum values are added to visualizations for a comprehensive understanding.

- Project Flexibility: The code can work with various datasets and allows customization, such as changing the country for analysis or columns for plotting.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook 'COVID-19 Data Analysis.ipynb' to perform analysis and visualization.
